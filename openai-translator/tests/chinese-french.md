Test data This dataset contains two test samples provided by OpenAI's AI language model ChatGPT. These samples include a Markdown table and an English text paragraph that can be used to test English-to-Chinese translation software that supports both text and table formats. Text Test The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence contains every letter in the English alphabet and is used to test fonts, keyboards, and other text-related tools with a complete alphabetical sentence. Many other languages also have complete alphabetical sentences, but some are harder to construct due to the unique characteristics of the language. Table Test
